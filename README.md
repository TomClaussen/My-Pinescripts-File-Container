# My-Pinescripts-File-Container
I like to play with pinescripts for indicators on TradingView and even do some options trading. The language seems simpler in many ways
than the little coding I have done (way back "Framework" by Ashton Tate which was similar to what I have seen of Visual Basic for Applicaions
that works, or at least used to with MS Office).
