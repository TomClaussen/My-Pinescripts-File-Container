# My-Pinescripts-File-Container
I like to play with pinescripts for indicators on TradingView and even do some options trading. The language seems simpler in many ways
than the little coding I have done (way back "Framework" by Ashton Tate which was similar to what I have seen of Visual Basic for Applicaions
that works, or at least used to with MS Office).

This (Github) may work to keep files organized or just archive text copies of scripts rather than losing them on my hard drive at home. :-)
The indicators I have published on Tradingview are all public under my user:
Tom1trader 
and there are a number that I have not published as 
yet that I have traded with and refined as well as some that are works in progress.
